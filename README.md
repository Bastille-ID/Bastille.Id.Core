# Talegen.AspNetCore.hCAPTCHA

Talegen **hCAPTCHA** Middleware & Model Validation Library for ASP.net Core.

This repository ([Bastille.Id.Core](https://github.com/Bastille-ID/Bastille.Id.Core)) is where we (Talegen) lead the development and maintenance of the Bastille.ID Core library. The source code here is available to everyone under the standard [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/Talegen/Talegen.AspNetCore.hCAPTCHA/blob/main/LICENSE).

The purpose of this library is to provide the shared core business logic for the Bastille.ID server between both the Identity Server, Identity API, and any related additional projects that need to interact with the Identity Server management business logic directly.
